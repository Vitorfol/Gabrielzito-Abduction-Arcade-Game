PROJECT-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

This document describes the functional and graphical requirements specific to the Claw Machine Arcade Game.

---

GAME FLOW

* Initial menu with difficulty selection
* Selection of the number of moving objects
* Game starts after menu confirmation
* Player can exit the game at any time using the ESC key

---

CLAW MECHANICS

* Claw starts at the top-center of the screen
* Free movement on the X and Y axes
* Claw open and close animation
* Grab attempt triggered by the SPACE key

---

OBJECT BEHAVIOR

* Objects move continuously inside the machine
* Object speed depends on selected difficulty
* Number of objects depends on initial configuration
* Objects remain inside machine boundaries

---

VIEW AND CAMERA

* Default internal view of the claw machine
* Viewport transformation triggered during grab action
* Zoom or focus effect during claw closing animation

---

GRAPHICS IMPLEMENTATION

* All game elements represented using polygons
* Polygon filling using scanline algorithm
* Support for per-vertex color gradients
* Support for texture-mapped polygons

---

COLLISION AND INTERACTION

* Detection of overlap between claw and objects
* Successful grab attaches object to the claw
* Failed grab returns the claw to its initial position

---

PERFORMANCE AND OPTIMIZATION

* Matrix-based transformations applied to all objects
* GPU acceleration for selected mathematical operations using CUDA
* Rendering pipeline designed to minimize redundant computations

---

NOTES
These requirements define the core mechanics and must be preserved throughout development.
